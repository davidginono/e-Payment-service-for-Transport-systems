This is a prototype of the implementation of the payment process for fare collection in the Transport sector.
This has focused on the Daladala sector which seems to be one of the most complex, informal and challenging sector in collecting fare.
This project implements api REST communications, database queries, and friendly front-end.
This is an ongoing project.
